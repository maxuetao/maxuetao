## Hi there 👋

I am currently a Ph.D student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University (BNU), under the supervision of Prof. [Hua Huang (黄华)](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/group/teacher/dcdaea79b5e54b75b532795109a85a34.htm). 
I am also a member of the [Intelligent Media Computing Laboratory](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/).

Prior to this, I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees from the College of Data Science, Taiyuan University of Technology, under the supervision of Assoc.Prof. [Daoxiang Zhou (周稻祥)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Ux2E8LIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

My current research interests are mainly in large language models (LLMs) and their applications. I am also very interested in computer vision and deep learning, especially face anti-spoofing and medical image processing <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZFwXqAAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fmaxuetao%2Fmaxuetao.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
